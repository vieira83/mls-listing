### Description
The real estate listing app, lists houses from the simplyreets trial test api. Every mlsid list can be saved to a firebase database. When the App loads inside App component we initialize firebase and get or set UserId in localStorage.  

The  React Real Estate Listing project is structured:
- **components**: Contains all stateless components.
- **containers**: class or smart components. Every component or container has itâ€™s own folder.
- **shared folder** : contains reusable utils and functions such API, Auth and local storage.
The Api is object literal containing a generic getAll method to fetch data for url. 
- **Services**:  contains services to get data from an api endpoint. the simplyReets service gets the all properties data.
- **config**: configurations files such as firebase config.

-  **CSS** :
Follows basic BEM format for styling, App_component__modifier (ex: App_header__darker). Since there are not an extensive amount of styling all the styles are in App.css and no real need for a css preprocessor. In the App.css the styles are grouped by component with a comment at the beginning identifying the session. This makes it easy to move blocks o styling to their own component css style if needed.
